# README for US Counties App #
Made by Tej Allada

This app was designed in App Lab using JavaScript. Its functionality is for the user
to selecet any US state and get an output return of all the counties in the respective
state, listed in aphbetical order.

The files in this folder contain everything you need to run the app:

* `applab/applab.js` - This file contains the applab library, which has all the
  javascript that applab uses to run the app.

* `applab/applab.css` - This file contains some default CSS styling for the app.

* `index.html` - This is the html file that you designed in applab using the
  Design tab. It contains all the buttons, text inputs, and other controls for
  the app. Go here to add additional controls to the app.

* `style.css` - This file defines the custom styling for each control in the
  app that you specified under the Design tab. Go here to change the colors,
  positions, dimensions, and other properties of the app's controls.

* `code.js` - This file has all the code you wrote for the app. Go here to add
  new behavior to the app.

* `assets` - This is a directory with all the asset files (pictures and sounds)
  that you uploaded in applab.
